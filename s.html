<p><i><u> undergraduate education is based on the concept of liberal arts and sciences.</u> You can take classes in a wide variety of subjects in addition to your major field of study. The bachelor’s degree is awarded after completing a specified number of credits in a major field of study. Think about credit hours as the number of hours spent per week in a classroom. Every course earns a certain number of credits, and each institution has its own requirement for the number of credits needed to graduate.</i></p>
<!--color-->

<p style="color:red;">The bachelor’s degree is usually completed in four years of full-time study. U.S. colleges and universities have student advisers who guide students in their choice of courses to reach the credit hours needed for graduation.</p>
